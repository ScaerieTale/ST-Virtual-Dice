# Roll a D20!

Or any other dice!  That's the beauty of this incredibly simple Command Line Interface app.  No matter what random dice number you give it, it will give you a random roll of those dice.

TO DO: I want to add an option to add attribute modifiers, as well as giving it a cool, lightweight visual interface.  Would love to port it to mobile as well. :-)

### Personal note
On a personal note, this is one of my favorite apps.  This was one of the VERY first apps I wrote completely myself without any help from a guide or anything.  I know it's a small script and not very impressive right now, but it's 100% my own code, and I'm proud of it. <3
